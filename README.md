# go-modemmanager
A Go wrapper around ModemManager's D-Bus API
### ðŸš¨ðŸš§ WIP/Experimental ðŸš§ðŸš¨

---

# What this is
- Wrapper for ModemManager's D-Bus API in Go
- (Mostly) usable
- Not battle-tested
- Unpolished

# Usage
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/parrotmac/go-modemmanager
```

# Run Example
```
$ go run cmd/dump.go
```
On a system with two Modems, the (formatted & slightly tweaked) output might look like this:
```json
